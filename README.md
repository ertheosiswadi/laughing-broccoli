  - `git branch` to check your current branch
  - If you're just starting the ticket, [create a new branch](git_stuff.md#create-a-new-branch-off-master): \
    Else: `git checkout <the ticket's branchname>`
- Cook the broccoli [tips and tricks](cooking_tips.md)
- Make git commits as needed ([cmd](git_stuff.md#commit-files-you-changed))
  - Only add changes you made. Sometimes you'll see that there are changes that you didn't make (submodule updates).

* Did my code pass the code checker? (log in as admin and go to Site Administration -> Development -> Code checker)

**When you're done** 
- Organize it to **one or several logical commits** (tip: [git squash](git_stuff.md#squashing-commits)). Use your senses :massage: .... When in doubt, ask Rex :raising_hand:

- Give yourself a pat in the back :clap: :relaxed:

### Please taste my broccoli (Passed Code Review)
When you've received your ticket back and it passed review

- @\<tester\> Please test \<possibly a cute emoji\>
- Assign your ticket to your tester
- Change the status from Code Review &#8594; Testing

### Reconsidering your friend's broccoli (Code Review)
- Understand the problem. Clarify with ticket owner
- Look for the link to the github commit
- Reconsider the broccoli
- [Peer review checklist](peer_review.md#peer-review-checklist)
- [Coding rules](cooking_rules.md#coding-rules)
- Make comments on Github or Jira as needed
